V2 work (V2A onboarding + docs, V2B-V4 roadmap) also has its own board:
`team/board-v2.md`.

## Active

- **Docs / lists / metric polish — 2026-05-21** (5 tracks, decomposed
  from `team/intake/2026-05-21-docs-lists-metric-polish.md`):
  - [docs-ui-prototype-alignment](contracts/docs-ui-prototype-alignment.md) — leaf · ready · P1 — restyle `/docs` to the folio-dark prototype visual language. Behavior preserved (deep links, sidebar filtering, loading/empty/error states); presentation only. Forbidden from touching docs content (owned by `2026-05-20-docs-user-and-agent-wiki.md`).
  - [list-search-filter-completion-audit](contracts/list-search-filter-completion-audit.md) — foundation · ready · P1 — single-deliverable audit doc at `docs/superpowers/audits/2026-05-21-list-surfaces-audit.md` inventorying every list-like surface in the SPA with its current search/filter/sort state. Blocks `list-search-filter-missing-surfaces`.
  - [list-search-filter-missing-surfaces](contracts/list-search-filter-missing-surfaces.md) — integration · blocked (on audit) · P1 — migrates every list surface the audit flags as missing search/filter/sort to the phase-1 list component stack.
  - [max-drawdown-danger-tone](contracts/max-drawdown-danger-tone.md) — leaf · ready · P1 — rewrite `drawdownToneClass` so any non-zero magnitude max DD renders red/danger across eval-runs list, run detail (desktop + mobile), compare table, and home (if applicable). Extract to a shared module and add tests.
  - [docs-search-list-component-adoption](contracts/docs-search-list-component-adoption.md) — leaf · deferred · P2 — optional follow-up to adopt the standard list component search/chip idiom for the docs sidebar. Stays deferred until `docs-ui-prototype-alignment` lands AND the audit confirms docs nav qualifies.

  Sequencing: `list-search-filter-completion-audit` first (foundation; ~1 day).
  `docs-ui-prototype-alignment` and `max-drawdown-danger-tone` are
  parallel-safe with each other and with the audit. The migration
  track (`list-search-filter-missing-surfaces`) flips to `ready` when
  the audit lands. The docs-list-adoption follow-up activates only on
  conductor flip after the prototype alignment merges and the audit
  recommendation supports it.

- **QA Round 4 — outstanding tail** (decomposed from
  `team/intake/2026-05-19-qa-operator-round-4.md`; 8 of 11 original
  tracks shipped via #341, 2 more via #339 and commit `11959db`):
  - [paper-eval-inspector-parity](contracts/paper-eval-inspector-parity.md) — integration · ready · P1 — paper eval inspector lacks PnL summary + buy/sell order rendering; backtest parity is the target. Root-cause first (engine persistence vs frontend loader fork), then fix.
  - [strategy-require-at-least-one-agent-fixture-migration](contracts/strategy-require-at-least-one-agent-fixture-migration.md) — leaf · ready · P2 — followup to #341 commit `3849680`. Migrate ~13 engine fixtures off the legacy `trader_slot` fallback, then delete the fallback branch in `validate_eval_trader_source`.
  - [scenario-clone-form-structural-fields](contracts/scenario-clone-form-structural-fields.md) — integration · ready · P2 — followup to #341 commit `53f3e3f`. Mount the already-lifted `<ScenarioForm>` inside the inline clone accordion on `/scenarios/:id` so operators can override `time_window` / `asset` / `granularity` / `venue` / `warmup_bars` without leaving the page.

  Sequencing: parallel. `strategy-require-at-least-one-agent-fixture-migration`
  and `paper-eval-inspector-parity` share `crates/xvision-engine/src/api/eval.rs`
  in disjoint regions; fixture-migration is smaller and should land first
  to keep `cargo test --workspace` green for the parity track's CI.

## Reserved

_(empty — next decomposition wave should come through intake; see
the V2 board for V2A leaves and V2E contracts already laid down.)_

## Recently Closed

Merged 2026-05-20 / 2026-05-21 (not yet archived):

- **Lists v1 phase 2** — full wave complete. `list-migrate-eval-runs` (#399, 2a), `list-migrate-strategies` (#400, 2b), `list-migrate-decisions-and-tail` (#403, 2c — also deleted the transitional `<ListPagination>` JSX primitive). Phase 3 (`list-component-density-toggle`) remains deferred. Ready to archive on the next conductor sweep.

Earlier — also not yet archived:

- **Lists v1 phase 2a** — `list-migrate-eval-runs` (#399). Migrated
  `/eval-runs` to `<ResponsiveListCard>` + `useListState` +
  `useListUrlState`; landed F-2 (search/filter) from QA Round 7.
  Pattern is the reference for 2b/2c.

QA Round 4 status reconciled 2026-05-21 (intake table updated, no archive yet — three tracks still open as `paper-eval-inspector-parity` / `strategy-require-at-least-one-agent-fixture-migration` / `scenario-clone-form-structural-fields`):

- **`mcp-eval-run-job-bridge`** — shipped via commit `11959db`. Synthetic `eval_run_<ULID>` bridge in `crates/xvision-dashboard/src/cli_jobs/eval_run_bridge.rs` resolves to the `eval_runs` registry without dual-writes; `get_cli_job` / `get_cli_job_output` accept the prefix.
- **`trace-capsule-multi-eval-behavior`** — shipped via implementation (#339); the design-spike step was bypassed and the multi-eval capsule was built directly from the operator's HTML mock at `docs/design/Capsule · Multi-Eval.html`.

Archived 2026-05-20 (conductor sweep — see `team/archive/2026-05-20-lists-v1-phase-1/`):

- **Lists v1 phase 1** — `list-component-port-desktop` (#390),
  `list-component-port-mobile` (#395), `list-component-tokens-reconcile`
  (#396), all merged 2026-05-20. Foundation `<ListCard>` / `useListState`
  / `<ListToolbar>` / `<ListActiveChips>` (1a), mobile `<MListCard>` /
  `<MListRow>` / `<MListSheet>` + `CLAUDE.md` no-popups exemption (1b),
  `<ResponsiveListCard>` wrapper + token audit (1c). Backend-pagination
  follow-up `{items, total}` envelope across all four list endpoints
  shipped via #397.
- **QA operator round 7** — all 9 findings shipped without contract
  files (intake-direct PRs). Trace wave F-5/F-7 (#385), List wave
  F-3/F-4 (#386 — recency-first sort + `ListPagination` primitive
  wired across eval-runs/strategies/scenarios/agents), Eval-inspector
  wave F-1/F-6/F-8/F-9 (#387), `decision_idx` populate follow-up
  (#391). F-2 (search/filter) **rolls into phase 2 list migration**
  rather than a separate quick fix.
- **QA operator round 6** — `scenario-form-calendar-whitespace` (P2),
  `scenario-runs-tab-show-eval-name` (P2),
  `agent-usage-panel-wire-deployed-and-runs` (P1) bundled in #360
  (2026-05-19, but archived in this sweep for traceability).
- **Skills refresh** — `xvision-cli`, `xvision-cli-qa`, `xvision-dev`
  refreshed for new xvn verbs in #379. `cycle-migration` explicitly
  punted by operator (narrow migration-authoring skill, not in the
  usage/contribution orientation surface this wave covers). Drift
  prevention shipped as "skills owner" footers.

Archived 2026-05-19 (conductor sweep — see `team/archive/2026-05-19-sweep/`):

- **Harness observability audit (F-2, F-6)** — `harness-span-attrs-populate` (#294, merged 2026-05-18) and `harness-typed-mechanical-params` (#302, merged 2026-05-18). F-6 added typed `MechanicalParams` enum keyed on `manifest.template` + `deny_unknown_fields` on briefing/decision/risk structs; single pre-persist validate seam in `StrategyStore::save`.
- **QA Round 5 F-1/F-2/F-3/F-5** — bundled in PR #316 (`qa-round-5: validate_draft false positive + silent retry loop fixes`, merged 2026-05-19). Cadence parser is unit-token-strict (F-1); chat-rail surfaces `validate_draft` errors inline with no popup (F-2); wizard loop force-ends after 2 same-error retries with a stuck card (F-3); `findings_model_for_provider` picks the right Haiku id per provider kind (F-5).
- **QA Round 5 F-4** — `risk-preset-balanced-min-order-sanity` resolved 2026-05-19. The balanced-preset 44+ `broker_min_order_size` warnings on ETH paper were closed out; no follow-up contract needed.
- **Parked** — `q15-tailscale-serve-api-reachability` retired from the Deferred lane (no operator demand). Contract archived; revive by restoring from `team/archive/2026-05-19-sweep/contracts/`.
- **Parked** — Agent CI/CD Phase-1 (5 contracts) moved into a handoff doc at `docs/superpowers/handoffs/2026-05-19-agent-cicd-phase-1-handoff.md`. Shadow-run gate already passed (`team/archive/agent-cicd-phase-1-shadow/`, 17/17 = 100%); resume by following the handoff's "How to resume" section.

- **V2A onboarding** — `v2a-in-app-docs` merged (closing out the V2A onboarding wave).
- **Harness observability audit (F-1)** — `harness-prompt-hash-real-digest` (#277). Replaces synthetic `eval:<run>:<span>` `prompt_hash` with real SHA-256 digest of `(system_prompt, messages, tools)`; `response_hash` now populated. Operator gate cleared (pre-harness image deployed). Unblocks F-3 prompt-version inference.

## V2B+ Intake

`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-v2-v4-action-plan.md` lists items 4-14
(auth boundary, kill switch, on-chain wallets, autoresearcher, audit). The
conductor decomposes one wave at a time. Do not freelance contracts from that
list without going through intake.
