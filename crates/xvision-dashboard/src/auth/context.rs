//! Canonical `AuthContext` — per-request caller identity.
//!
//! This is the single, authoritative dashboard-side identity type consumed by
//! every route that needs to know who is making the request. The engine has
//! its own smaller `xvision_engine::safety::AuthContext` (kept separate to
//! avoid a circular crate dep — see that type's doc).
//!
//! # Shape contract
//!
//! At minimum `{ user: String, source: String }` — chosen so the stub swap
//! in `v2b-remote-cli-job-safety` and `v2b-broker-wallet-kill-switch` is a
//! one-line import change without breaking call sites.

/// Caller-identity snapshot captured at the point of authentication.

/// For session-token requests this is populated from the `dashboard_sessions`
/// row. For loopback requests (always allowed) this is populated from the
/// request metadata. For Tailscale CLI requests this may carry the Tailscale
/// node name (see `README.md` for the exemption rationale).
